- Integration Testing (Feature)

## Different Tests

- Unit tests test the Models, which interact with the database.

- Controller tests test the Controllers, which communicate info between the models and views. A controller accepts input and sends commands.

- Integration tests test the Views in the browser as well as the user experience. In other words, whatâ€™s being presented as HTML to users of the app.

## Integration Tests (Feature)
