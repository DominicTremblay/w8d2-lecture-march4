- Integration Testing (Feature)

## Different Tests

- Unit tests test the Models, which interact with the database.

- Controller tests test the Controllers, which communicate info between the models and views. A controller accepts input and sends commands.

- Integration tests test the Views in the browser as well as the user experience. In other words, what’s being presented as HTML to users of the app.

## Integration Tests (Feature)

- A lot more high-level than unit tests, which focus on the technical details and business logic of your models.

- Describe flows on and between your pages.

- Feature tests which are based on your user stories, check if the requirements are being met or not
